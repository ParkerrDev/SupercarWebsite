                <h2>Richard Patterson</h2>
                <p>Richard Patterson (Rich), CEO & CTO of Trion Supercars, realized a lifelong dream in May 2012 after
                    40 years in the automotive industry by founding Trion with a core team of experts.</p>

                <p>Rich's passion for cars started in his Detroit childhood, and at 15, he earned a GM apprenticeship
                    after winning a statewide drafting contest. A graduate of Mumford High School and Hall of Fame
                    inductee, Rich began his career as a CAD designer at Modern Engineering, quickly rising to
                    leadership roles due to his expertise in automotive interior systems.</p>

                <p>With over two decades of experience, including contributions to Chrysler's Stow 'n Go seating
                    system, Rich moved to the West Coast to immerse himself in design innovation. Today, he brings his
                    vision to life with Trion Supercars, offering high-performance American-made supercars that combine
                    style, speeds of 300 mph, and comfort, with options ranging from traditional engines to hybrid and
                    fully electric models.</p>
